The facade design features perforated screen walls that filter daylight and create an ever-changing play of shadows, colors, and reflections. These patterns bring warmth and softness to the minimal exterior while maintaining privacy for the interior spaces. All service functions are placed in the basement, ensuring a calm and organized patient zone above.Green spaces integrated across the site — both outdoors and within the interior — enhance the building’s connection to nature, improving air quality and overall well-being. Together, these elements create a functional, symbolic, and serene healthcare space rooted in the idea of purification and renewal.",
