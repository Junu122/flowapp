                    <ul className="vision-points">
                        <li><b>Flow Architects</b> is a multidisciplinary architectural studio based in Kerala, known for its
                            thoughtful and context-driven approach to design. The firm engages in a diverse range of works
                            — from residential and commercial buildings to interior design for homes, offices, and
                            clinics — each shaped by a focus on functionality, clarity, and the user’s everyday experience.</li>
                        <li>Guided by a belief that architecture should flow — with its surroundings, with people, and with
                            purpose — the studio’s work reflects clarity in planning, ease of circulation, and sensitive
                            response to context. Every project begins with an open mind, evolving through close
                            collaboration with clients and careful consideration of site, spatial quality and functionality.</li>
                        <li>While modern minimalism forms the base of design language, Flow Architects embraces a
                            flexible and evolving philosophy. The studio responds intuitively to the unique character of each
                            project — whether it calls for rooted traditional values, timeless colonial charm, or a bold
                            contemporary expression.</li>
